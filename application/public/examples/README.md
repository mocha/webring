# Widget Examples!

These pages are intended to help you test and/or experiment with widget styling. Each points at http://localhost:3000 for local hacking on the widget code. To do so, you'll need to:

1. Run the application locally

```
cd application
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Run the test pages locally in another terminal

```
cd examples
npx http-server
```
